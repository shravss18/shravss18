Intro into time series forecasting

So first, we have an actual promlem that a company or client provides us. 
From there we arrive to the statistical problem with the help of EDA. 
EDA stands for Explorative data analysis. 
From the statistical problem we get the statistical solution using a model. 
A model is made by us that we seem fitting for the problem at hand. 
The Model is fed a cretain quantity of the entire data set. This data is known as the training data. 
From this training data, we get certain values after the Model is done proccessing it. 
These values are compared with the testing data. 
If difference in the accuracy is very less, then the model is considered good to go. 
The accuracy is calculated using MAPE
While performeing calculations on data, there aren't supposed to be any null values. If there are, then mean of the rest of the data is found and the value is written in the null area. 


Things to remember about python:
semi colons (;) aren't used anywhere
python is case sensitive
since python doesn't use brackets, indentation is very important
